        MemberPass was founded by Fai Wong and Grant Levy in Sydney, Australia. The idea for MemberPass was conceived when Fai was waiting for 10 minutes before his yoga class begins. This means 20% of class time was spent taking payments by cash, giving change and taking attendance.

        It wasn't long before Fai met Grant who was working on a similar idea in the same space. For the last 14 years, Grant has been in the fitness industry running a personal training business. After looking at what was available in fitness and wellness space, we found out that they all charge between $80-$250 a month and are built for club owners.

        We talked with customers of service providers. Stephanie, mother of two and company director has 5 providers (whom she pays by cash and communicates by phone) would love to have them on MemberPass so she could do that all in one place. In her words: "Busy people are more than happy to pay a little more to save time".
      </p>
      <p>
        Realising that both the service providers and their customers could benefit greatly from having a community where fast and flexible payments is the norm, we set out to build a product that saves everyone time so they can focus on their passion.
